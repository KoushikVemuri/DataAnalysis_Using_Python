# Smartwatch Data Analysis

This project analyzes the data collected from a smartwatch, focusing on various aspects of activity and health metrics over a period of time. The analysis provides insights into the relationship between daily steps, calories burned, activity levels, and trends over the course of a week.

## Dataset

The dataset used for analysis was sourced from Kaggle. You can access it using the link below:

## Project Overview

The dataset contains information about the total steps, distance traveled, and the time spent in various activity levels (very active, fairly active, lightly active, and sedentary) for multiple individuals. The project uses Python and various libraries (e.g., Pandas, Plotly, Matplotlib) to clean, analyze, and visualize the data.

### Key Features:
- Analysis of daily activity minutes and calories burned.
- Insights into activity patterns by day of the week.
- Visual representation of relationships between steps and calories.
- Breakdown of activity levels (e.g., very active, fairly active, sedentary) over time.

## Visualizations

Below are the key visualizations generated in the project:

### 1. Calories Burned vs. Total Steps
A scatter plot showing the linear relationship between the number of steps taken and the calories burned.

## Insights:
- **Highest Activity**: Wednesdays are the most active day, with the highest average number of calories burned.
- **Inactive Trends**: Tuesdays tend to be the most sedentary day across the dataset.
- **Active vs. Inactive**: A significant portion of the data shows that most people remain inactive for a large portion of the day, with only a small amount of time spent in very active or fairly active states.
